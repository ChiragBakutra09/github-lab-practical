GitHub collaboration provides a cloud-based platform where multiple developers can work on the same project without overwriting each other's changes.
It uses Git for version control, allowing teams to manage code changes through features like branching, pull requests for code review, and issue tracking to streamline the development workflow.
This system ensures code quality and fosters effective communication and teamwork across distributed environments
