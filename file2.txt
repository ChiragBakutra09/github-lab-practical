GitHub branches are independent lines of development that allow developers to experiment with new features or fix bugs in isolation from the main codebase (typically the main branch).
Each branch acts as a lightweight pointer to a series of commits, ensuring that changes do not interfere with the stable, deployable version of the project.
Once the changes in a branch are complete and reviewed (via a pull request), they can be merged back into the main branch to incorporate them into the project.
